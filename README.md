This is the header file for the List class. It includes the function declarations which are implemented in the List.cpp file.

### List.cpp
This is the main implementation file of the List class. It includes the definitions of all the manipulation and access functions for our List.

### Shuffle.cpp
This file contains a client program for the Doubly Linked List ADT implementation.

### ListTest.cpp
This file contains a client program for the Doubly Linekd List ADT. It's a standalone application that uses the functionality provided by the Dictionary class. It can be used as a reference to understand how to utilize the Doubly Linked List ADT.
